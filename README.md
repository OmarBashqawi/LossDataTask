## Learning Process:

- Gained an understanding of key concepts such as **loss triangles**, **chain-ladder method**, **IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported)** claims, and **link ratios**, and learned how to calculate them.

- Processed the Excel file by sorting the data first by **Accident Month**, then by **Reported Month**, which helped make the data more readable and easier to understand.

- Started programming in Python with the following steps:
  1. Imported the necessary libraries.
  2. Loaded the Excel data into the program.
  3. Converted the **Accident Month** and **Reported Month** columns to **datetime** format for easier manipulation.
  4. Calculated the **development months** and created the **loss triangle**.
  5. Converted the loss triangle into a **cumulative triangle**.
  6. Computed the **link ratio** for each period.
  7. Applied the **chain-ladder method** to estimate missing values (NaN).
  8. Calculated the **IBNR** based on the completed data.
