Learning process:
1) Learned about loss triangle, chainladder, IBNR, link ratio and how to calculate them.

2) reading the excel file and sorting the data by Accidant month then by reported month to make the data more readable and easier to understand.

3) started programming using python:
   a) imported the libraries thst I'm going to use.
   b) read the excel file
   c) changing the format to datetime for the Accident and Report monthes.
   d) calculating the development months and making the loss triangle.
   e) converting the loss triangle to cumulative triangle.
   f) calculating the link ratio.
   g) using chain-ladder method to fill the nan value with estimated value.
   h) finding IBNR
